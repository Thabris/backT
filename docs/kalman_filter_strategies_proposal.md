## Kalman Filter Fundamentals

### State Space Model

The Kalman filter models a financial time series as:

```
State Equation (Process Model):
x(t) = A * x(t-1) + w(t)

Observation Equation (Measurement Model):
y(t) = H * x(t) + v(t)

Where:
- x(t) = Hidden state (true price, velocity, etc.)
- y(t) = Observed measurement (market price)
- A = State transition matrix
- H = Observation matrix
- w(t) ~ N(0, Q) = Process noise (how much the model can change)
- v(t) ~ N(0, R) = Measurement noise (how noisy the observations are)
```

### Key Parameters

**Q (Process Noise Covariance):**
- Controls how much the filter trusts the model
- **Higher Q** = Filter adapts quickly to changes (responsive but noisy)
- **Lower Q** = Filter assumes stable model (smooth but slower)
- Typical range: 0.0001 to 0.1

**R (Measurement Noise Covariance):**
- Controls how much the filter trusts observations
- **Higher R** = Filter smooths more (assumes noisy data)
- **Lower R** = Filter follows observations closely
- Typical range: 0.01 to 10.0

**Optimal Ratio Q/R:**
- High ratio (Q >> R): Fast adaptation, follows price closely
- Low ratio (Q << R): Slow adaptation, heavy smoothing
- Typical for price: Q/R â‰ˆ 0.001 to 0.01

## Proposed Strategies for BackT

### Strategy 1: Kalman-Enhanced Moving Average Crossover

**Concept:** Replace traditional MAs with Kalman filter estimates

**Traditional Approach:**
```python
SMA_fast = price.rolling(10).mean()
SMA_slow = price.rolling(50).mean()
signal = SMA_fast > SMA_slow  # Buy when fast > slow
```

**Kalman Approach:**
```python
KF_fast = KalmanFilter(Q=0.01, R=1.0)  # More responsive
KF_slow = KalmanFilter(Q=0.001, R=1.0)  # More smooth
signal = KF_fast > KF_slow
```

**Advantages:**
- No lag from lookback window
- Adapts to volatility regimes
- Smoother signals with fewer whipsaws
- Real-time adjustment

**Implementation Details:**
```python
State: x = [price, velocity]
A = [[1, dt],
     [0, 1]]  # Constant velocity model

H = [1, 0]  # Observe only price

Q = [[q_price, 0],
     [0, q_velocity]]

R = [r_price]
```

**Entry/Exit Rules:**
- **Buy:** When Kalman_fast crosses above Kalman_slow
- **Sell:** When Kalman_fast crosses below Kalman_slow
- **Optional:** Add z-score filter (only trade if |z-score| < 2)

**Expected Performance:**
- Fewer false signals vs. SMA
- Better risk-adjusted returns
- Improved Sharpe ratio

---

### Strategy 2: Kalman Mean Reversion with Adaptive Bands

**Concept:** Use Kalman filter to estimate "fair value" and trade deviations

**Logic:**
```python
fair_value = KalmanFilter(price, Q=0.001, R=1.0)
deviation = price - fair_value
z_score = deviation / rolling_std(deviation, 20)

# Entry signals
buy_signal = z_score < -2.0  # Price too low
sell_signal = z_score > 2.0  # Price too high

# Exit signals
exit_long = z_score > -0.5
exit_short = z_score < 0.5
```

**Advantages:**
- Dynamic fair value estimation
- Adapts to regime changes
- Natural stop-loss at mean reversion failure

**Parameter Tuning:**
- **Conservative:** Q=0.0001, R=5.0, z_threshold=2.5
- **Moderate:** Q=0.001, R=1.0, z_threshold=2.0
- **Aggressive:** Q=0.01, R=0.5, z_threshold=1.5

**Comparison with SMA-based mean reversion:**
- Research shows Kalman version reduces drawdown significantly
- Better performance in trending markets
- More stable z-scores

### Strategy 3: Kalman Pairs Trading with Dynamic Hedge Ratio

**Concept:** Use Kalman filter to estimate time-varying hedge ratio between cointegrated pairs

**Traditional Approach:**
```python
# Static hedge ratio
hedge_ratio = ols_regression(stock_A, stock_B).slope
spread = stock_A - hedge_ratio * stock_B
```

**Kalman Approach:**
```python
# Dynamic hedge ratio using Kalman filter
State: x = [hedge_ratio, intercept]
Observation: stock_A = hedge_ratio * stock_B + intercept + noise

# Filter estimates both parameters in real-time
spread = stock_A - kalman_hedge_ratio * stock_B - kalman_intercept
```

**Research Results (2023):**
- **Holding yield increased from 1.6% to 16.2%**
- **Max drawdown reduced to 0.02%**
- Better adaptation to changing market correlations

**Implementation:**
```python
State: x = [beta, alpha]  # Hedge ratio and intercept
Measurement: y = price_A
Model: price_A = beta * price_B + alpha + noise

A = [[1, 0],
     [0, 1]]  # Parameters evolve slowly

H = [price_B, 1]  # Observation includes both stocks

Q = [[0.0001, 0],
     [0, 0.001]]  # Small process noise

R = [0.1]  # Measurement noise
```

**Trading Rules:**
- Calculate spread using Kalman-estimated hedge ratio
- Enter when |spread_z_score| > 2.0
- Exit when spread_z_score crosses zero
- Stop loss if |spread| > 3.0 std deviations

**Advantages:**
- Adapts to changing correlations
- No need for periodic recalibration
- Handles cointegration drift
- Better performance in non-stationary markets

### Strategy 4: Kalman Trend-Following with Velocity

**Concept:** Estimate both price and velocity (momentum) using Kalman filter

**State Space:**
```python
State: x = [price, velocity]
Observation: y = market_price

# Constant acceleration model
A = [[1, dt, 0.5*dt^2],
     [0, 1,  dt],
     [0, 0,  1]]

State = [price, velocity, acceleration]
```

**Trading Logic:**
```python
# Extract components from Kalman filter
estimated_price = kalman_state[0]
estimated_velocity = kalman_state[1]

# Signals
buy_signal = (estimated_velocity > velocity_threshold) and (price > estimated_price)
sell_signal = (estimated_velocity < -velocity_threshold) or (price < estimated_price)

# Typical threshold: velocity_threshold = 0.001 (0.1% per day)
```

**Advantages:**
- Direct momentum estimation (no lookback needed)
- Leading indicator (velocity predicts future price)
- Natural trend strength filter
- Adaptive to volatility

**Research Support:**
- Nkomo et al. (2013) K-AC-M algorithm showed superior excess returns
- Alpha Architect (2022) demonstrated improved trend detection
- PyQuantLab (2025) added trailing stops for enhanced performance

### Strategy 5: Multi-Timeframe Kalman Ensemble

**Concept:** Use multiple Kalman filters with different Q parameters

**Implementation:**
```python
# Fast filter (responsive)
KF_fast = KalmanFilter(Q=0.1, R=1.0)

# Medium filter (balanced)
KF_medium = KalmanFilter(Q=0.01, R=1.0)

# Slow filter (smooth)
KF_slow = KalmanFilter(Q=0.001, R=1.0)

# Ensemble signal
trend_strength = (KF_fast - KF_slow) / KF_slow
trend_quality = correlation(KF_fast, KF_medium, KF_slow)

# Trade only when all aligned
buy = (KF_fast > KF_medium > KF_slow) and (trend_quality > 0.95)
sell = (KF_fast < KF_medium < KF_slow) and (trend_quality > 0.95)
```

**Advantages:**
- Robust to parameter sensitivity
- Multiple confirmation levels
- Natural regime detection
- Lower false signal rate

    def update(self, measurement):
        # Prediction
        x_pred = self.x
        P_pred = self.P + self.Q

        # Update
        K = P_pred / (P_pred + self.R)  # Kalman gain
        self.x = x_pred + K * (measurement - x_pred)
        self.P = (1 - K) * P_pred

        return self.x

---

## Parameter Tuning Guidelines

### Starting Values

**For Price Smoothing:**
- Q = 0.001 (smooth), 0.01 (moderate), 0.1 (responsive)
- R = 1.0 (standard)

**For Mean Reversion:**
- Q = 0.0001 to 0.001 (prefer stable mean)
- R = 0.5 to 2.0 (balance noise vs. adaptation)

**For Trend Following:**
- Q = 0.01 to 0.1 (need responsiveness)
- R = 0.5 to 1.0 (trust observations more)

**For Pairs Trading:**
- Q_hedge_ratio = 0.0001 (hedge ratio stable)
- Q_intercept = 0.001 (intercept can drift)
- R = 0.1 to 1.0

### Optimization Approach

1. **Grid Search:**
   ```python
   Q_range = [0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1]
   R_range = [0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0]

   # Test all combinations
   optimizer.optimize(
       param_grid={'Q': Q_range, 'R': R_range},
       optimization_metric='sharpe_ratio'
   )
   ```

2. **Walk-Forward Validation:**
   - Train on 2 years
   - Test on 6 months
   - Roll forward

3. **Regime-Based:**
   - Use different parameters for high/low volatility
   - Detect regime with VIX or realized volatility
