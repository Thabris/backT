# Backtesting Research & BackT Framework Gap Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Purpose:** Comprehensive research on backtesting best practices, academic insights, and recommendations for BackT framework enhancements

---

## Executive Summary

After extensive research into academic papers, professional backtesting tools, and industry best practices, I've identified several critical gaps in the current BackT framework. While BackT has a solid foundation with event-driven architecture, realistic execution modeling, and comprehensive metrics, it lacks advanced validation techniques that are now considered essential in academic and professional quantitative finance.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ **Strong Foundation:** Event-driven engine, realistic execution, good metrics coverage
- ⚠️ **Major Gap:** No walk-forward analysis or cross-validation capabilities
- ⚠️ **Critical Missing:** No protection against backtest overfitting (purging, embargoing, CPCV)
- ⚠️ **Important Missing:** No transaction cost impact analysis, regime detection, or Monte Carlo validation
- ⚠️ **Documentation Gap:** No guidance on avoiding data snooping bias

## Part 1: Academic Research Findings

### 1.1 Backtest Overfitting - The #1 Problem in Quantitative Finance

**Key Research:**
- **"Backtest Overfitting" (2021)** - Oxford Academic Significance Journal
- **"Pseudo-mathematics and financial charlatanism"** (2014) - Notices of the AMS
- **"A Backtesting Protocol in the Era of Machine Learning"** (2019) - Arnott, Harvey, Markowitz

**Critical Findings:**
> In a study of 452 anomaly indicators in finance, **82% failed** when tested with proper multiple testing corrections (t > 2.78 threshold).

> Most academic finance journals fail to require authors to declare the full extent of computer trials involved in a discovery.

**The Problem:**
- Trying multiple strategy variations on the same dataset leads to false discoveries
- Traditional single-path backtesting is extremely sample-inefficient
- Standard train/test splits are inadequate for time-series financial data
- Sharpe ratios are massively overstated without deflation techniques

**What This Means for BackT:**
Our current backtesting approach allows users to run unlimited variations on the same data without any safeguards against overfitting. This is dangerous and can lead to strategies that perform well in backtest but fail catastrophically in live trading.

### 1.2 Data Snooping Bias

**Key Research:**
- **Lo & MacKinlay (1990):** "Data-Snooping Biases in Tests of Financial Asset Pricing Models"
- **White (2000):** "A Reality Check for Data Snooping" - Econometrica
- **Harvey et al. (2015):** "... and the Cross-Section of Expected Returns"

**The Problem:**
Data snooping occurs when:
1. Researchers test multiple hypotheses on the same dataset
2. Only successful results are reported (publication bias)
3. Strategies are optimized through iterative testing
4. Parameter tuning is done on the full dataset

**Recommended Solutions:**
- **Deflated Sharpe Ratio (DSR):** Adjusts for multiple testing
- **Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER) control:** Bonferroni corrections
- **False Discovery Rate (FDR):** Controls expected proportion of false positives
- **Out-of-sample testing:** Mandatory hold-out periods
- **Pre-registration:** Declare strategy before testing

**What This Means for BackT:**
We need tools to track how many strategies/parameters have been tested and warn users about inflated statistics. We should also provide DSR calculation as a standard metric.

---

### 1.3 Cross-Validation for Time Series - Purging & Embargoing

**Key Research:**
- **Marcos López de Prado:** "Advances in Financial Machine Learning" (2018)
- **De Prado (2018):** "The 7 Reasons Most Machine Learning Funds Fail"
- **"Combinatorial Purged Cross-Validation"** - Multiple papers 2019-2024

**The Problem with Standard K-Fold CV:**
Financial data has **serial correlation** and **overlapping labels** (e.g., returns over N days). Standard k-fold CV causes massive leakage:

```
Standard K-Fold (WRONG for finance):
Train: [----] Test: [--] Train: [----]
       ^ Training data AFTER test period = LEAKAGE!
```

**Solution 1: Purging**
Remove training observations whose labels overlap in time with test labels.

```python
# Example: If predicting 5-day returns
# Test period: Days 100-105
# MUST PURGE: Training days 96-99 (their labels extend into test period)
```

**Solution 2: Embargoing**
Remove training observations immediately AFTER test periods to prevent reverse leakage.

```python
# After test period ends at day 105:
# EMBARGO days 106-110 from training
# (prevents using information that "knew" about test period)
```

**Solution 3: Combinatorial Purged Cross-Validation (CPCV)**
Generates MULTIPLE backtest paths instead of just one chronological path:

**Benefits:**
- Tests strategy on N different historical scenarios (not just one path)
- Calculates **Probability of Backtest Overfitting (PBO)** metric
- Provides distribution of Sharpe ratios (not just one number)
- Dramatically reduces false discoveries vs walk-forward (WF)

**Research Results:**
> CPCV demonstrates marked superiority in mitigating overfitting risks, outperforming traditional methods with lower PBO and superior DSR test statistics.

**What This Means for BackT:**
This is **THE MOST IMPORTANT MISSING FEATURE**. We need to implement CPCV as the gold standard for strategy validation.

---

### 1.4 Walk-Forward Analysis - Industry Standard

**What It Is:**
Sequential out-of-sample testing where you train on period 1, test on period 2, retrain on periods 1+2, test on period 3, etc.

```
Period 1: [Train----] [Test--]
Period 2: [Train--------] [Test--]
Period 3: [Train------------] [Test--]
```

**Advantages:**
- Mimics real-world deployment (always using past data to predict future)
- Provides realistic performance expectations
- Shows how strategy degrades over time

**Limitations (per recent research):**
- Only tests ONE chronological path (sample inefficient)
- Doesn't protect against overfitting as well as CPCV
- Early periods have very little training data
- Specific to the historical sequence (not robust to order)

**What This Means for BackT:**
Walk-forward is table stakes for any professional backtester. We need this, but should complement it with CPCV.

### 2.2 Transaction Cost Modeling - Best Practices

**Research Findings:**

**Components of Realistic Transaction Costs:**

1. **Fixed Costs:**
   - Commission per trade
   - Exchange fees
   - Regulatory fees
   - ✅ BackT supports this

2. **Variable Costs (Size-Dependent):**
   - Bid-ask spread
   - Market impact (price moves against you for large orders)
   - Slippage
   - ⚠️ BackT has basic support, needs enhancement

3. **Advanced Modeling:**
   - **Non-linear market impact:** Cost increases non-linearly with order size
   - **Temporary vs permanent impact:** Price recovers partially after trade
   - **Liquidity-based costs:** Costs vary by market conditions
   - **Queue position modeling:** For limit orders
   - ❌ BackT does NOT have these

**Academic Models:**

**Almgren-Chriss Model (2000):**
```
Market Impact = σ * √(Q/V) * f(urgency)

Where:
- σ = volatility
- Q = order quantity
- V = average daily volume
- f = function of execution urgency
```

**Square-root Law:**
```
Cost ∝ √(Order Size / Daily Volume)
```

**What This Means for BackT:**
Our current slippage model is too simplistic. We need:
- Volume-adjusted market impact
- Separate temporary/permanent impact
- Liquidity filters (reject trades when volume too low)

---

---

### 3.2 Critical Gaps ❌

#### Gap 1: No Overfitting Protection (CRITICAL)

**Missing:**
- No walk-forward analysis
- No cross-validation (purged/embargoing)
- No CPCV
- No Deflated Sharpe Ratio
- No PBO (Probability of Backtest Overfitting)
- No tracking of strategy attempts
- No warnings about data snooping

**Impact:** HIGH
**Risk:** Users will develop overfit strategies that fail in live trading

**Fix Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

---

#### Gap 2: Limited Transaction Cost Realism (IMPORTANT)

**Missing:**
- No volume-adjusted market impact
- No non-linear cost scaling
- No temporary vs permanent impact
- No liquidity filtering
- No dynamic costs based on market regime

**Current Implementation:**
```python
# backt/execution/mock_execution.py - Too simplistic
cost = spread + (slippage_pct * trade_size) + commission
```

**Should Be:**
```python
# Volume-adjusted market impact
volatility = calculate_recent_volatility(symbol)
daily_volume = get_daily_volume(symbol)
market_impact = volatility * sqrt(order_size / daily_volume) * urgency_factor
temporary_impact = market_impact * 0.6  # Recovers
permanent_impact = market_impact * 0.4  # Stays

# Reject if liquidity insufficient
if order_size > 0.1 * daily_volume:
    return PartialFill or Reject
```

**Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH
**Risk:** Overestimated performance for strategies with high turnover or large orders

**Fix Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

---

#### Gap 3: No Monte Carlo / Bootstrap Validation (IMPORTANT)

**Missing:**
- No Monte Carlo simulation of equity curves
- No bootstrap resampling of returns
- No regime-based scenario testing
- No stress testing tools

**Why Important:**
Single backtest = single data point. Monte Carlo gives you a **distribution** of outcomes.

**Example Use Cases:**
1. **Path randomization:** Shuffle order of trades, see if Sharpe holds up
2. **Return resampling:** Bootstrap daily returns, generate 1000s of equity curves
3. **Worst-case analysis:** What if drawdowns were 2x worse?
4. **Confidence intervals:** "Strategy has 80% probability of Sharpe > 1.0"

**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Risk:** Users have false confidence in point estimates

**Fix Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM-HIGH

---

#### Gap 4: No Regime Detection / Market State Filtering (MEDIUM)

**Missing:**
- No volatility regime detection (VIX-based, GARCH)
- No trend/range detection
- No correlation regime monitoring
- No performance by regime reporting

**Why Important:**
Strategies perform differently in different market conditions. Reporting should show:
- Performance in bull/bear/sideways markets
- Performance in high/low volatility regimes
- Performance when correlations break down

**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Risk:** Users don't understand when their strategy works/fails

**Fix Priority:** 🟢 MEDIUM

---

#### Gap 5: Limited Optimization Tools (MEDIUM)

**Current Status:**
- Basic parameter grid search exists (`backt/optimization/optimizer.py`)
- No walk-forward optimization
- No genetic algorithms
- No Bayesian optimization
- No overfitting penalties in optimization

**What's Needed:**
- Walk-forward optimization (optimize on Period 1, test on Period 2, etc.)
- Robust optimization (optimize for worst-case, not best-case)
- DSR-aware optimization (penalize overfitting during optimization)

**Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM
**Risk:** Users optimize parameters without proper validation

**Fix Priority:** 🟢 MEDIUM-LOW

---

#### Gap 6: No Multi-Asset / Multi-Strategy Support (LOW-MEDIUM)

**Current Status:**
- Single strategy per backtest
- Stocks only (no futures, options, crypto, FX)
- No strategy allocation/combination
- No asset class correlation analysis

**What Professional Tools Have:**
- Portfolio of strategies with allocation optimization
- Multi-asset class support
- Cross-asset hedging
- Strategy correlation analysis

**Impact:** LOW
**Risk:** Limited to single-strategy stock backtests

**Fix Priority:** 🟢 LOW (nice-to-have)

## Part 6: Quick Wins (1-2 weeks)

While working on major features, these can be done quickly:

### Quick Win 1: Add DSR to Current Metrics (1 day)
Just add DSR calculation to existing metrics output. Users can manually specify n_trials.

### Quick Win 2: Liquidity Warning (1 day)
Check if order size > 10% daily volume, print warning.

### Quick Win 3: Regime Labels in Reports (1 day)
Tag each backtest period with bull/bear/sideways label, show in results.

### Quick Win 4: Multiple Testing Warning (1 day)
Add manual counter in Streamlit: "How many strategies have you tested? [5]" → Show DSR adjusted for that.

### Quick Win 5: Better Slippage Documentation (1 day)
Add academic references and recommended values based on strategy type.
